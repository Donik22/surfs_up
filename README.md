- Count of (June,December) = (1700,1517)
- Average Temperature of (June,December) = (74.94 ℉ ,71.04 ℉) 
- June Minimum and Maximum Temperature = (64 ℉,85 ℉)
- December Minimum and Maximum Temperature = (56 ℉,83 ℉)

# Summary

## Data limitations
This Analysis is based only on temperature for a given date. For a surf shop buisiness many other factors can be considered like (customer behavioral, Popularity of the area ,political/global events ,etc.). 


## Aditional Analysis
From the data we collected we can predict that june would be the best month to stock up on supplies in the store given the temperature is higher in june. The scatter gives us more oportunity to track the daily temperature during a given month.
